## Delve

Camilo gripped the doorknob again, this time gathering his strength. "What's wrong, Milo?" Alex was kneeling besides Martina a few paces away, helping her up. The three of them were in a beautifully furnished reading room, the sort you saw in movies: a fancy-looking single couch facing a lit fireplace at an angle, a dark-crimson rug covering the entire floor, and ceiling-high shelves filled with books covering most of the walls. Milo half-expected to see a hunting trophy above the fireplace, but there was no such thing, like a missing puzzle piece. "Grandpa had a few friends like that, but he never saw the fun in it" Tina had said when he'd voiced his disappointment. Still, you didn't see many places like this in this line of work.

"It's just a little stuck, let me try again" he turned his attention back to the door and turned the knob again, this time pushing the door against the frame at different angles in an attempt to help it open. This time the door budged and he could spy a bit of the next room, the crimson rug from the reading room giving way to a familiar, weaved, pale yellow pattern. The door wasn't so much stuck as behind a bunch of heavy boxes; one of them had caught onto the floor somehow which prevented it from moving, but thanks to the extra strength had become loose enough to push. Tina was leaning on Alex for support but was well enough to walk, and the trio crossed the threshold. "I guess if I had that kinda money I'd rather spend it on books than hunting rifles too", Milo ventured towards Tina before Alex closed the door behind them. She looked at him with a clueless expression. "Your grandpa" he clarified, which didn't seem to help things. Alex shot a glare at Milo "Where are we anyway?", he asked in an attempt to change the subject and with genuine curiosity. "Oh, this one's mine", said Milo. "I spent a semester in an exchange program in Japan, this used to be my room. That door we came through was a small closet, didn't have much of a use for it after packing". 

The room was just big enough for a student to live in; it had space for a bed - an actual bed, not a futon as Milo had expected before arriving - a decently sized desk with enough space for a laptop and whichever pile of books his advisor had dictated he read, and a small knee-high table in the center. The tatami flooring had seemed novel at first but by the end of the semester he barely thought anything of it. "I doubt there will be anything of much value here. It's not like I could bring many people over and most things happened outside". "Well, there has to be *something*, let's get looking" Alex insisted, clearly interested in the contents of the room beyond just what they were looking for. Martina seemed to have recovered almost completely, and began looking as well. Milo let his eyes wander around the room, his hands trailing the walls and his feet following the black lining of the tatami panels, like they used to whenever he took a break from studying. His eyes quickly settled on a pale glow, coming from inside a small bag sitting on a desk corner. "Ah, there" he said pointing at the bag. He grabbed it and let the contents fall into the center table. A pile of letters sat underneath a small glowing orb. "Just before I left a bunch of friends from the program wrote me these good-bye letters. I guess I did get a bit emotional over them back then..." he trailed off with a sigh. "God, this is fucked" said Martina suddenly "don't grab it, it's not worth it". Alex and Milo were taken aback, but Alex quickly recovered. "It's the job" he said coldly "you just did the same thing back there and Milo didn't stop you". Martina looked at the door behind which the reading room stood no longer. She looked like she didn't believe Alex, as if he'd just referenced a memory she was struggling to recall. Alex sighed; "you're new, you'll get used to it".

Milo took the glowing orb with one hand and balanced it on his palm. It was the size of a small lemon, and glowed an off-white blue. He wondered if the corporation's scientists knew what the color meant. He wondered if they cared. Not wanting to prolong this ritual any longer, he squeezed tight. The orb felt like a balloon filled with some sort of jello, and as he felt it rupture he felt a familiar dull pain on his temple. He closed his eyes and let his mind go blank as the last of the orb turned into smoke between his fingers. "Let's go", he muttered, standing up and walking without much difficulty towards the door opposite from the one they'd just come through. Tina was the one to linger this time before they closed the door from the next room (a kitchen with a smell of cinammon and vanilla that had kicked them in the face as they crossed the threshold). "Yeah, but *I* deserve it", she muttered under her breath.

The trio continued making their way through the rooms, sublimating what charged memories they could find. Tina reminisced with them about her aunt's cooking before forgetting her favorite cookie recipe, Alex found one the size of a cantaloupe hiding inside a shelf filled with arts and crafts materials from his attempts at becoming an artist (a fact he didn't care to share), and Milo stumbled upon several marble-sized ones glowing a variety of colors at his favorite seat in a diner from his hometown. The places were deserted, as always, and were setup such that none of them would encounter two of their rooms in consecutive order. The incursions required at least three people, after all, presumably so they could get some rest before they had to sublimate their next memory, and so they had company and couldn't get too in their own heads, a pun corporate had become particularly fond of, plastering it all over their good practices manuals and employee wellness ads. The three of them soon fell into a good cadence, with Alex leading the way as the more experienced delver. He'd dreaded bringing a newbie along, but Tina had grown used to sublimating fairly quickly and didn't look so drained after each of her rooms anymore. She'd piqued his interest: her rooms revealed a life of luxury not usually seen between other delvers, her surprise at how the whole thing worked gave him the impression she'd not done much research beforehand, and she looked like she had something to prove. He only wished that drive would last the rest of their shift.

Milo got up from the dirty floor of a factory warehouse, smoke coming from his hand. Disoriented, he looked around the room as if he'd just walked in; "well, this one doesn't look like anything I'd care to remember anyway". He shrugged, and started heading towards the door. "Wait!" Tina, who had barely spoken in what seemed like hours yelled at the top of her lungs, the word reverberating throughout the warehouse like the echoes of a ringing bell. Milo stopped in his tracks. "God, what is it?", Alex replied, "there's just the three of us in here, there's no need to yell". "I... I don't think we are. Alone, I mean", came her reply. "What?" - "I just saw something move, over there" she pointed at a pile of wooden boxes not too far from where they were standing. Alex scratched at the back of his head, wondering what he could say to sound reassuring, but Milo spoke before he could. "I've heard their filter can sometimes fail, and let something or someone slip through. It's dangerous, they can make the projections collapse since they're not actually meant to be spaces compatible with complex memo-" "shut up, Milo, no one cares", Alex snapped at him "what did it look like?" he asked Tina. "I don't know, I just saw something leaping through the boxes. Maybe it was just a trick of the light... wait, look!" she pointed at a space between the boxes but there was no need, Milo and Alex were already frozen in place. A bright light had erupted from in-between two boxes, and other boxes stacked further in casted a jumble of shadows on the far wall of the warehouse. The trio stood like statues as they saw a huge, black cat walk from behind the pile, its belly glowing as if it'd just swallowed the sun itself. It yawned at them, and a beam of light shot from its mouth, casting more shadows on the opposite wall. "Get. that. cat.", Alex whispered, his eyes glistening with the recognition of a golden opportunity.
